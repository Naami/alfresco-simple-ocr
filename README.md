Downloading the ready-to-deploy-plugin
--------------------------------------
The binary distribution is made of one amp file to be deployed in Alfresco as a repo module:

* [repo AMP](https://github.com/keensoft/alfresco-simple-ocr/releases/download/1.1.1/simple-ocr-repo.amp)

You can install them by using standard [Alfresco deployment tools](http://docs.alfresco.com/community/tasks/dev-extensions-tutorials-simple-module-install-amp.html) in `alfresco.war`


Building the artifacts
----------------------
If you are new to Alfresco and the Alfresco Maven SDK, you should start by reading [Jeff Potts' tutorial on the subject](http://ecmarchitect.com/alfresco-developer-series-tutorials/maven-sdk/tutorial/tutorial.html).

You can build the artifacts from source code using maven
```$ mvn clean package```


Installation
----------------------

OCR software for Linux depends on programs like `gs` or `ImageMagick`, which are also dependencies for Alfresco. In order to avoid problems, it's recommended to install Alfresco from scratch, letting the OS the installation of the packages. 

You can find detailed instructions to perform Alfresco installation from scratch at [Alfresco Documentation](http://docs.alfresco.com/community/tasks/alf-tomcat-install.html).

If you are using Linux and your Alfresco is installed by using [default wizards](http://docs.alfresco.com/community/concepts/simpleinstalls-community-intro.html), you must pay attention to environment execution for programs launched inside your JVM and you must adjust versions and path precedence.

You can find more options to solve this problem at the [FAQ](https://github.com/keensoft/alfresco-simple-ocr/wiki/FAQ) page.
